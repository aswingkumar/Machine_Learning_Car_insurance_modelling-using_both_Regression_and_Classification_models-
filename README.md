# Machine_Learning_Car_insurance_modelling-using_both_Regression_and_Classification_models-to_predict_best_models

In this analysis of predicting insurance claims, both regression and classification models were explored to understand and predict the number of claims and the likelihood of a claim being made by a driver. The models were evaluated based on performance metrics, and the key findings are summarized below:
## Regression Task (Predicting Number of Claims):
Linear Regression was used initially, but its performance was limited due to the nature of the target variable (number_of_claims), which is a count of claims. A more suitable model would be Poisson regression or a Random Forest Regressor to capture the count data's nature.

Random Forest Regressor provided strong results, offering flexibility and accuracy for predicting the number of claims, even though it was not the perfect model for the task. Other models like Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree also showed promise but underperformed compared to Random Forest in this case.

## Classification Task (Predicting Claim Likelihood):
The binary classification model (claims_class) was introduced to predict whether a driver had made any claims or not.
Logistic Regression emerged as the top performer in terms of accuracy, precision, and ROC-AUC, making it an ideal model for identifying the likelihood of a driver making any claims.
Random Forest was a strong contender, especially for tasks where recall or F1-score is prioritized, as it showed better recall, which is essential when minimizing false negatives (i.e., drivers who should have made claims but were predicted as not doing so).
Gradient Boosting, despite its general effectiveness in other scenarios, performed poorly in this specific task and should be reconsidered for further optimization or replaced by simpler models.

This analysis has provided valuable insights into how different models can be leveraged for insurance claim prediction and classification tasks, and suggests avenues for improvement in both model choice and optimization.

Car insurance modeling is a vital tool for the insurance industry, enabling companies to make data-driven decisions that improve operational efficiency, reduce risks, and optimize pricing strategies. By analyzing historical claims data and leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning models, insurers can predict claim frequencies and severities with greater accuracy. This not only enhances risk management but also supports better customer segmentation and fraud detection. The insights gained from such modeling empower insurers to remain competitive in a dynamic market while delivering value to their customers. Overall, car insurance modeling serves as a cornerstone for achieving strategic business goals through the effective use of data.
